<h1>New Pictoral Church Directory</h1>

<p>We will be producing a new pictorial church directory and need you in it to make it the best ever.</p>
<h2>To make a photo sitting reservation, <a href="https://www.securedata-trans14.com/ap/firstpresbyterianchurch56/index.php?page=10" target="_blank">click here</a> or make a reservation in person during coffee hour on September 27, October 4 or 11.</h2>
<p>There are many reasons why a complete church directory is a valuable tool. The most obvious one is that our membership has grown by well over 50 since our last one was published.  A complete pictorial directory also shows how very fortunate we are to have such a diverse membership.  We have an older population who carry our history; we have a growing, younger population who embody our future; and we have so many in between who are living our present with you.  As a church this is an enviable position to be in and not one we should hide.</p>
<p>Every participating family/individual will receive a free 8&quot;x10&quot; color wall portrait, and every family will receive a free directory.</p>
<p>Photographs will be taken on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday October 14, 15 and 16, from 2:00-9:00, Saturday, October 17, from 10:00-5:00 and Tuesday, October 20, from 2:00-9:00 in the Parlor.</p>
<p>If you have questions, please contact Pat Piddington, 203.452.9123 or patpidd@earthlink.net.</p>
