<h1 style="padding-bottom: 50px;"><a name="top" target="_parent"></a>Mission Outreach</h1>

<p>We participate in a variety of ministries that declare and demonstrate God's love, as shown supremely in Jesus Christ, in our community, our nation, and our world. We strive to maintain a balance of discipleship,  education, and relief efforts. We encourage you to get involved in one of these ministries, and we welcome your recommendations of additional ways we can serve. To God be the glory!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.operationhopect.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Operation Hope</strong></a></p>

<p>On the second Saturday morning of each month, church members prepare meals for the residents of Operation Hope’s shelter. We typically cook for roughly 45 people using the ample commercial-style kitchen at our church. The meals are then delivered to the shelter. Our church also provides financial support for their food pantry, affordable housing, and shelter programs.</p>
<p><a href="https://bridgeportrescuemission.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Bridgeport Rescue Mission</strong></a></p>
<p>BRM demonstrates the love of God to the hungry, homeless, and addicted throughout Coastal Fairfield County, providing services and a place of hope and dignity for men, women, and children. Every Wednesday evening, volunteers from FPC  join the Bridgeport Rescue Mission to serve hot meals to those in need from a BRM van. We also collect clothing and non-perishable foods for BRM, and we support their fundraising efforts. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.habitatcfc.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Habitat for Humanity of Coastal Fairfield County</strong></a></p>
<p>Members of our congregation play an active role with Habitat for Humanity Coastal Fairfield County, which has built over 200 homes in Fairfield County since 1985.  Volunteers from FPC work on the last two Saturdays of each month; however, Habitat works every day except Sundays. Volunteers can help with home construction, office work, or their ReStore retail shop.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.menaulschool.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Menaul School</strong></a></p>
<p>Founded in 1896 in New Mexico by Presbyterian minister Rev. James Menaul, this independent school remains related to the Presbyterian Church. It accepts students from all cultural, religious, and socio-economic backgrounds; half the students receive need-based financial assistance. Our church supports the school through the collection of General Mills box tops and Campbell’s labels (see the envelope on the Mission Committee’s bulletin board).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bridgeportedu.com/sva/" target="_blank"><strong>Student Volunteers Association of Bridgeport</strong></a></p>
<p>SVA’s mission is to enrich and support the learning of Bridgeport’s public school students by involving volunteers from Bridgeport and surrounding communities. Our church members foster the love learning by participating in their annual Read Aloud Day, as well as their tutoring, mentoring, and Book Buddy programs.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.ccgb.org/CCGB/LCM-ChildrenServ" target="_blank">Project Learn Program</a> (part of the Council of Churches of Greater Bridgeport)</strong></p>
<p>Project Learn helps close the achievement gap through a neighborhood-based network of learning centers, with after-school programs that help inner-city children overcome the hurdles of growing up in poverty. FPC provides financial support to both Project Learn and the <a href="http://www.ccgb.org/CCGB/" target="_blank">Council of Churches</a> and, at Christmas, we create an Angel Tree to collect gifts for Project Learn children and mittens, hats and gloves for the Curiale School in Bridgeport.</p>

<p>First Presbyterian embarked on its first international mission trip in August 2014. Having financially supported a medical outreach effort and an orphanage in Ghana, several members of our church traveled went to become more personally aware of the situation and the need. </p>
<p><img src="/images/mission_ghana_02.jpg" /></p>
<p>In August 2015, more members of our church returned to Ghana to begin to lay the groundwork for partnerships with two Presbyterian Churches and their ministries.</p>
<p><img src="/images/mission_ghana_01.jpg" /></p>
<p>We are now in the process of developing a partnership with these churches, which will involve fellowship, service, evangelism, and financial support. We are excited to see how God uses this new friendship in Christ to bless both sides of the Atlantic!</p>
