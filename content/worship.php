  <br />
  We warmly welcome you to join us for worship every Sunday at 10 a.m. We focus on reading and proclaiming Scripture, singing, sharing prayer concerns, and celebrating the Lord's Supper (first Sunday of the month). Communion is also offered on Ash Wednesday, Maundy Thursday, and Christmas Eve. For infants and toddlers we offer loving childcare in the nursery located on the first floor of the Christian Education wing of our building. For children ages 3 through Grade 5 we provide dynamic Small Groups, which leave from the Sanctuary after the children's talk. Please join us on Sunday mornings!</p>
